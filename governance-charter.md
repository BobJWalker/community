# Governance Charter

## Overview

This document describes the bootstrap governance process under which the project will operate
until the final governance process is identified.

## Goals

The initial role of the governance committee is to **instantiate the formal
process for OpenFeature governance**. In addition to defining the initial
governance process, the bootstrap committee strongly believes that **it is
important to provide a means for iterating** the processes defined by the
governance committee. We do not believe that we will get it right the first
time, or possibly ever, and wonâ€™t even complete the governance development in a
single shot. The role of the governance committee is to be a live, responsive
body that can refactor and reform as necessary to adapt to a changing project
and community.

## Governance Committee

The _Governance Committee_ is responsible for
representing the project,
making a final decision if a consensus cannot be reached (see _Decision Making_),
handling the Code of Conduct escalations,
defining and approving with the project members the final governance model,
and organizing elections for the elected governance board body.

### Governance Committee Members

[Governance Committee Members](./community-members.md#governance-board)

> NOTE:
> In April 2022 _Project Maintainers_ assigned five seven individuals to be members of the _Bootstrap Governance Committee_.
> This is a **temporary** arrangement that should be replaced by an elected governing body before March 2024.


## Decision making

Decisions are made by a consensus of _Project Members_ and [Interested Parties](./interested-parties.md).
If this consensus cannot be reached,
the decision can be made by the plain majority vote of _Bootstrap Governance Committee Members_.

<!-- TODO: List founding members or delegate the decision to CDF TAG App Delivery or another entity -->

Key discussions and decisions should happen asynchronously in communication channels like GitHub Issues, discussions or pull requests.
Technical decisions are expected to be documented in the
[OpenFeature Specification](https://github.com/open-feature/spec).
The community decisions should be documented in this Governance repository.

## Meetings

The project conducts [regular project meetings](https://github.com/open-feature/community#meetings-and-events)
hosted by its maintainers and contributors.
These meetings are used as additional discussion and consensus building
but not for making decisions without prior discussion in async channels.


#### Bootstrap Governance Committee Members

> :warning: This is a **temporary role** while the bootstrap governance is active.
> In the future this role will be replaced by an elected _Governance Committee Member_ role.

Bootstrap Governance Committee members are responsible for representing the project in communications with organizations,
including but not limited to contributor companies, adopters, vendors and foundations.
Apart from the representative role,
they can make a final decision when a consensus cannot be reached.

In April 2022 this role will be assigned by project maintainers to **seven** individuals listed in [Interested Parties](./interested-parties.md).
Each company/organization should have less than 50% of the seats,
and hence an organization can have only up to three seats.
The project maintainers are also responsible to review their nominations with the community,
and to do the best effort to address any feedback/concerns.
